# Tiny Factory Docs

This repo is a collection of engineering and design docs we use at TinyFactory.  They span a large array of topics from system engineering, infrastructure setup, interface engineering and design.  We have put together a pretty to make it easier to browse:

These docs are collaborative.  If you see an issue, by all means point it out to us or ask for write access.  We are easy to get ahold of via Twitter [@TinyFactorySD](http://www.twitter.com/TinyFactorySD) or via e-mail, [hello@tinyfactory.co](mailto:hello@tinyfactory.co).
