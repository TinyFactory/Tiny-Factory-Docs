# How does it work?

I'm in the command line a lot, but not every moment of every day, so I often forget these gems. This list is more for me, but if you have some you would think should be added, let me know.

Human readable recursive directory size
	du -hs dir/

Compare two directories and output what files are different
	diff -qr dir1/ dir2/
