## Basic Branching

To create a new branch locally

```bash 
$ git checkout -b "new-branch-name"
Switched to a new branch "new-branch-name"
```

To view your local branches
```bash 
$ git branch
```

To view all branches 
```bash 
$ git branch -a
```

To view all remote branches 
```bash 
$ git branch -a
```

To push *only* the current branch
```bash 
$ git push origin [branchname]
```
