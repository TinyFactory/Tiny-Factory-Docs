Itâ€™s time to take health care real time. Node.js, MongoDB, Socket.io.

Core server tech stack:
- Amazon EC2
- MonogoDB
- Node.js
- Socket.io

We have developed a real time application leveraging the capabilities of Web Sockets and Node.js to revolutionize an ageing (literally and figuratively) segment of the health care industry.  We are a funded start up looking to expand our system engineering team.  A strong understanding of Javascript with an extreme passion for working on complex problems in highly dynamic environments is a must.

If you are interested in applying, respond to this post with a single link to a site that you have developed and explain your role.  Additionally write a function call that would console.log the number 8 using the following function definition foo:

{% highlight js %}
function foo(a, b){
	b(function(){
		return a+a;
	});
}
{% endhighlight %}

Send your answer to [hello@tinyfactory.co](mailto:hello@tinyfactory.co), and we'll be in touch.
